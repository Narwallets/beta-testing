# Welcome frontier explorers!

This repo contains instructions and links to current Beta-Testing on Narwallets

## Rewards

* Are there rewards? I was told there would be rewards.
  * Yes. NEP-141 tokens will be awarded, at our sole discretion but based on collaboration, participation, ideas, design, bug reporting, and good PR's. Maybe there is a Swingline Red Stapler Narwallets NFT for outstanding collaboration.
  
* When?
  * After the beta-test period, during mainnet launch.
  
* What kind of NEP-141 tokens? 
  * Governance tokens for the DApps
  
* What will be the value of those NEP-141 tokens? 
  * It's unknown. It depends on the project tokenomics, the success of each project, and the future demand of the tokens.

## How to Participate

* You need to be able to `git clone` a repository to operate with the latest version (unstable)
* You need to `git pull` the repo before testing to work with the latest version
* This is beta software. You're operating with no guarantees. 

## Installing the Software

We're developing additions to Narwallets' chrome-extension at the same time we develop DAO and DApps. It's common for fixes to affect both codebases. 
To be able to test the latest version of the software, you need to install Narwallets' chrome-extension **in developer mode**

#### Step 1

* git clone the Narwallets-chrome-extension from the command line

```
> git clone https://github.com/Narwallets/narwallets-extension
```

#### Step 2

* Open the chrome web browser
* Select the 3-point menu [ â‹® ] on the top-right, then "More Tools/Extensions"
* Activate **Developer Mode** (top right)
* Click on **[Load Unpacked]** (top left)
* Navigate to the dir where you cloned `narwallets-extension` on Step 1
* select the dir: `narwallets-extension\extension`

#### Step 3

* Click the extensions icon [ðŸ§©] in chrome (top rigth)
* Click the pin for Narwallets [ðŸ–ˆ] 
* Now you can use Narwallets (beta) by clicking on the icon. 

## Keeping the Software updated

* Before testing or whenever fixes are announced on [Narwallets' discord](https://discord.com/invite/tG4XJzRtdQ), remember to update your repository:
```
> cd narwallets-extension
> git pull
```
